## Simply chained list

A simply chained list is a sequence of nodes, where each node contains information of some data type and the address of the next node.
The current project consists of a basic implementation of a simply chained list.

The program is developed in the C programming language

### The program provides 7 options
1 - Insert at the beginning
</br>2 - Insert at the end
</br>3 - Show
</br>4 - Change list
</br>5 - Delete 1 element
</br>6 - Delete all
</br>0 - Finish

For the current project, we have taken as a basis the idea that no repeated numbers will be inserted.

Run the program preferably in visual studio code. Running it in the Clion compiler I found some unexplained bugs.
