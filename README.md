## Simply chained list

A simply chained list is a sequence of nodes, where each node contains information of some data type and the address of the next node.
The current project consists of a basic implementation of a simply chained list.

The program is developed in the C programming language.

### The program provides 7 options
<ul>
  <li>Insert at the beginning</li>
  <li>Insert at the end</li>
  <li>Show</li>
  <li>Change list</li>
  <li>Delete 1 element</li>
  <li>Delete all</li>
  <li>Finish</li>
</ul>

For the current project, we have taken as a basis the idea that no repeated numbers will be inserted.

Run the program preferably in visual studio code. Running it in the Clion compiler I found some unexplained bugs.
